## Coffee Shop Perception Analysis (Class Project)

In my Market Analysis and Control course, I worked on a project examining how customer perceptions of sanitation protocols varied across states during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically focusing on major chain coffee shops.

Using RStudio, I:
- Cleaned and transformed survey data using `dplyr`  
- Conducted independent-sample t-tests to compare safety perceptions between states  
- Visualized results with `ggplot2` bar graphs and boxplots

This project helped me connect real consumer behavior with data interpretation and understand how local policy and brand consistency affect customer trust.

## A/B Analysis for Instagram Content Themes

As part of an independent case study, I reviewed post engagement data from a small retail business and created a simulated A/B test comparing two types of Instagram post styles: product demos vs. lifestyle photos.

I analyzed:
- Engagement metrics (likes, shares, and saves) across 3 weeks of sample posts  
- Patterns in time of day, caption length, and post type  
- Basic summary statistics and visual comparisons in R

This helped me explore how data-backed decisions can refine a brand's visual strategy and build more consistent performance across social channels.

## Survey-Driven Persona Mapping

I designed and analyzed a mock consumer survey to create customer personas for a hypothetical wellness brand. Questions covered purchase behavior, brand perception, and lifestyle preferences.

Key steps included:
- Coding and cleaning multiple-choice survey responses  
- Segmenting users into groups based on behavioral patterns  
- Drafting detailed persona summaries with visual charts

This project showed how structured data collection can support targeted messaging, product development, and campaign alignment.

## Portfolio Website Performance Tracking

As part of building this portfolio site, I established basic performance tracking strategies using mock data to simulate page visits, resume downloads, and link clicks.

I created:
- Line graphs to visualize visit frequency over time  
- Funnel-style flow charts to simulate user behavior  
- Summaries of which sections received the most interest

This reinforced how web analytics supports digital branding and gave me practice applying analysis to content performance in a personal context.

## Summary

Marketing analytics has allowed me to bridge technical skills with strategic thinking. From hypothesis testing to content engagement analysis, Iâ€™ve learned how to turn raw data into meaningful insights. I look forward to continuing to apply these tools in roles that require both curiosity and clarity.
