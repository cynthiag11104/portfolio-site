## Local Pop-Up Campaign: **"Weekend Treats Market"**

I partnered with a weekend pop-up food market to develop a digital strategy to boost local awareness and foot traffic. My role included:

- Creating branded flyers and Instagram content tailored to Gen Z and family audiences  
- Running a 10-day Instagram countdown with polls and vendor previews  
- Launching a geotargeted Instagram ad campaign with a limited $75 budget

The campaign led to a 40% increase in follower engagement and helped the market reach capacity by noon on opening weekend. This project taught me how to work with tight budgets, fast timelines, and grassroots-level branding.

## Social Content Launch: **"Coach & Create" Personal Training**

I worked as a freelance digital content assistant for a local personal trainer building her first brand identity online. I helped her:

- Design a logo and branded Canva templates for daily posts  
- Develop a 30-day posting calendar that balanced fitness tips, testimonials, and behind-the-scenes content  
- Set up Linktree and Instagram Story Highlights to guide users through services

By the end of the 30 days, she gained over 150 new followers, booked two new clients through DMs, and continued using the templates for weeks. It helped me understand the content needs of new, solo entrepreneurs and how branding can build credibility quickly.

## Pop Culture-Based Campaign: **"Screen & Stream Saturdays"**

Inspired by my interest in content creation and entertainment, I conceptualized a social media series called “Screen & Stream Saturdays” — a weekly post format that blended binge-worthy shows with creative ad mockups.

I created:
- Graphics pairing fictional ad campaigns with trending shows (e.g., a skincare ad for a drama series character)  
- Sample captions, hashtags, and engagement hooks like “Who wore it better?” or “Which character needs this the most?”  
- A portfolio of mockups to show off my eye for trend-based digital marketing

Though not tied to a client, the project allowed me to experiment with voice, visual storytelling, and social humor — and served as a creative testbed for campaign ideas.
