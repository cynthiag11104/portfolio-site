My work blends statistical analysis, survey insights, and visual storytelling to uncover trends and guide strategy.\n\n---\n\n\nIn my Market Analysis and Control course, I worked on a project examining how customer perceptions of sanitation protocols varied across states during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically focusing on major chain coffee shops.\n\nUsing RStudio, I:\n- Cleaned and transformed survey data using `dplyr`  \n- Conducted independent-sample t-tests to compare safety perceptions between states  \n- Visualized results with `ggplot2` bar graphs and boxplots\n\nThis project helped me connect real consumer behavior with data interpretation and understand how local policy and brand consistency affect customer trust.\n\n---\n\n## A/B Analysis for Instagram Content Themes\n\nAs part of an independent case study, I reviewed post engagement data from a small retail business and created a simulated A/B test comparing two types of Instagram post styles: product demos vs. lifestyle photos.\n\nI analyzed:\n- Engagement metrics (likes, shares, and saves) across 3 weeks of sample posts  \n- Patterns in time of day, caption length, and post type  \n- Basic summary statistics and visual comparisons in R\n\nThis helped me explore how data-backed decisions can refine a brand's visual strategy and build more consistent performance across social channels.\n\n---\n\n## Survey-Driven Persona Mapping\n\nI designed and analyzed a mock consumer survey to create customer personas for a hypothetical wellness brand. Questions covered purchase behavior, brand perception, and lifestyle preferences.\n\nKey steps included:\n- Coding and cleaning multiple-choice survey responses  \n- Segmenting users into groups based on behavioral patterns  \n- Drafting detailed persona summaries with visual charts\n\nThis project showed how structured data collection can support targeted messaging, product development, and campaign alignment.\n\n---\n\n## Portfolio Website Performance Tracking\n\nAs part of building this portfolio site, I established basic performance tracking strategies using mock data to simulate page visits, resume downloads, and link clicks.\n\nI created:\n- Line graphs to visualize visit frequency over time  \n- Funnel-style flow charts to simulate user behavior  \n- Summaries of which sections received the most interest\n\nThis reinforced how web analytics supports digital branding and gave me practice applying analysis to content performance in a personal context.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nMarketing analytics has allowed me to bridge technical skills with strategic thinking. From hypothesis testing to content engagement analysis, I’ve learned how to turn raw data into meaningful insights.
